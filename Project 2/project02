Computer Project #2 -- Combinational Circuits (Part I)

Assignment Overview:

  This assignment develops familiarity with combinational circuits.  You will
  design the combinational circuits specified below.

  It is worth 40 points (4% of course grade), and must be completed no later
  than 11:59 PM on Thursday, September 17.

Assignment Specifications:

  Consider your nine-character MSU PID as a sequence of hexadecimal digits.
  You will design combinational circuits which recognize those digits and map
  them to the appropriate segments in a seven-segment display.

  A seven-segment display uses seven LEDs to represent hexadecimal digits.
  Assuming the seven segments are labeled as shown below, then each digit can
  be displayed by lighting a subset of the segments.

        a
       ---
      |   |
    f | g | b
       ---
      |   |
    e | d | c
       ---

  For example, the hexadecimal digit '9' can be displayed by lighting all of
  the segments except segment e.  Similarly, the hexadecimal digit 'A' can be
  displayed by lighting all of the segments except segment d.

  Your circuits will accept four inputs (the four bits in a hexadecimal digit)
  and will produce eight outputs:  the "Present" signal and the seven signals
  associated with the seven-segment display.

  The "Present" signal will be asserted when the four input signals represent
  a hexadecimal digit in your personal MSU PID; it will be deasserted for all
  other cases.  That is, the function will recognize the hexadecimal digits
  which are present in your MSU PID.

  For each hexadecimal digit which appears in your MSU PID, the circuits will
  will produce the correct value for each of the display signals.  Otherwise,
  the value of each display signal is irrelevant.

  Your design will be formalized by completing the requested information in
  the file "~cse320/Projects/project02.design".

Assignment Deliverables:

  The deliverable for this assignment is:

    proj02.design -- the text file for your design

  Be sure to use the specified file name, and to submit your file for grading
  via the handin system.



Assignment Notes:

  1) The following chart indicates which segments are used for a given
  hexadecimal digit.

     ---+--------------------
      0 | a, b, c, d, e, f
      1 | b, c
      2 | a, b, d, e, g
      3 | a, b, c, d, g
      4 | b, c, f, g
      5 | a, c, d, f, g
      6 | a, c, d, e, f, g
      7 | a, b, c
      8 | a, b, c, d, e, f, g
      9 | a, b, c, d, f, g
      A | a, b, c, e, f, g
      B | c, d, e, f, g
      C | a, d, e, f
      D | b, c, d, e, g
      E | a, d, e, f, g
      F | a, e, f, g

  2) The minimized expressions for your eight functions must be given in sum
  of products form.  That is, each function must be expressed using one or
  more products (AND terms), and at most one sum (OR term).

  3) In Part II of this assignment, you will implement and test the circuits
  which you designed.
