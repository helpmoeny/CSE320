Lab Exercise #5 -- Number Systems (Instructor Notes)

A. Fixed Point Numbers

1. Perform each of the indicated base conversions.  For readability, write a
blank between each group of four digits in binary and hexadecimal numbers.

a) Give the hexadecimal equivalent of each of the following binary numbers.

   1001 1100 0010 1011 1111 0101 0000 0111 =   9c2b f507

   0001 1010 0011 1101 0110 0100 1000 1110 =   1a3d 648e


b) Give the binary equivalent of each of the following hexadecimal numbers.

   5e8d =  0101 1110 1000 1101

   a72b =  1010 0111 0010 1011


c) Give the hexadecimal equivalent of the following decimal numbers.

   599 =  257

   253 =  fd


d) Give the binary equivalent of the following decimal numbers.

   125 =  0111 1101

   248 =  1111 1000


e) Give the decimal equivalent of each of the following numbers.
 
   47f base 16 =  1151

   162 base 7 =  93


2. When you have completed Question (1), use the executable program in the
file named "~cse320/Labs/lab05.convert" to check your work.

B. ASCII Representation

1. Give the ASCII representation of each of the following character strings in
hexadecimal.  Don't forget to include any spaces (blanks).

   "abcd"       61 62 63 64

   "ABCD"       41 42 43 44

   "Go State!"  47 6f 20 53 74 61 74 65 21

   "43.7"       34 33 2e 37

   "CSE 320"    43 53 45 20 33 32 30


2. When you have completed your work, use the executable program in the file
named "~cse320/Labs/lab05.ascii" to check your work.


C. Twos Complement Representation

Suppose that a machine uses twelve-bit registers to hold signed integers and
uses twos complement arithmetic.

1. What is the largest signed number that can be represented?  Give your
answer in both binary and decimal.

   Binary:   0111 1111 1111

   Decimal:  +2047


2. What is the smallest signed number that can be represented?  Give your
answer in both binary and decimal.

   Binary:   1000 0000 0000

   Decimal:  -2048


3. Give the twelve-bit internal representation of each of the following
decimal numbers.

   +317   0001 0011 1101

   -183   1111 0100 1001


4. Give the decimal value of each of the following twelve-bit numbers.

   1110 1011 0011  -333

   0001 1011 1011  +443
